\begin{abstract}
OOQP is an object-oriented software package for solving convex
quad\-ratic programming problems (QP).  We describe the design of
OOQP, and document how to use OOQP in its default configuration. We
further describe OOQP as a development framework, and outline how to
develop custom solvers that solve QPs with exploitable structure or use
specialized linear algebra.
